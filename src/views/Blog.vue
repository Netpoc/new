              As a rule of thumb, 60% of your living room should be a dominant 
              color, 30% should be a secondary color, and 10% should be an 
              accent color.

          The family unit is the building block of life for every individual and 
          the stage upon which identity and the first stage of self-awareness is 
          forged. There are certain characteristics and habits we get comfortable 
          with and we often replicate to people around us and to our immediate 
          environment as well because of what we were thought and also impressed 
          on us from our homes. What makes a family worth is physical and eternal 
          value is Love. With love deep rooted in the family, they become 
          indivisible, cohesive, strong and stand by each other no matter what. 
          Having said this, we all will acknowledge that family values are the 
          fundamental principles that make the fibers of our personality 
          indestructible, adaptive and preservative but where that value wasnâ€™t 
          laid well or met with tragic event from childhood then that individual 
          is on thin ice and only a matter of time before they break.
