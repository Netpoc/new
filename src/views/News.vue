                  In another news, it is reported on the Superscreen Live 
                  breakfast show that Oxford Group Nigeria, a real estate 
                  company has joined other corporate bodies in helping 
                  needing Nigerians  get through this trying period of our 
                  nation. In that light, the real estate firm would be going 
                  out on Monday 30th March to give out N10,000.00 each to 
                  over 500 families within the Alimosho local government Area, 
                  in social response to the effect of the stay at home order 
                  by the federal government because of covid-19 pandemic, 
                  which so far has had adverse economic toll on well-meaning 
                  Nigerians.
